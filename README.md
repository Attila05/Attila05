Hi,

I'm Attila. I started to learn front-end development(Coursera) and full-stack development(Odin Project) at the same time. Unfortunately, I got a full time job (not remote) in a completely different work field, but I learn as much as I can in my free time. When I finished with my tasks, I'm uploading them here. 

Have a nice day!
